Phase 1 Project

## Problem
Microbusinesses are susceptible to external factors such as economic conditions and government regulations, making it difficult to keep them afloat. Recently, COVID-19 had a major impact on the US economy and on the Microbusinesses which employ about 62 Million Americans.
The past trends may help us forecast what the future might look like for Microbusinesses. We aim to perform Microbusiness Density forecasting taking into account several factors(data) including the census data.  This will help these Businesses make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and product development.

## Our solution
Low-risk - Exploring the data and finding meaningful patterns using clustering.
Medium-risk - Constructing a baseline forecast using ARIMA and Prophet models.
High-risk - Adding US Census data to our dataset, building an advanced ensemble of models and beating medium risk accuracy by 10%.
